# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My first web site has some brief information about Vitamins, each of my pages describe one vitamin type. The data was gathered from wikipedia and the images were chosen through web search.

My Project 0 had a home page (index.html) that has 4 hyperlinks to:
Page1 contains un ordered list
Page2 contains ordered list
Page3 contained a table
page4 contains bootstrap grid

Style.css is a sass compiled css
Stylesheet.css is my css styling file
SassStyle.scss is the sass file that has nesting, inheritance and a variable example.
All the pages have hyperlinks on the top to move to other pages in the project
