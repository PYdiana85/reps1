            <h2>Vitamin C</h2>
            <p>Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid and ascorbate, is a vitamin found in various foods and sold as a dietary supplement.[3] It is used to prevent and treat scurvy.[3] Vitamin C is an essential nutrient involved in the repair of tissue and the enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters.[3][4] It is required for the functioning of several enzymes and is important for immune system function.[4][5] It also functions as an antioxidant.[6]</p>
            
         
            <h5>Plant sources</h5>
<p>While plant foods are generally a good source of vitamin C, the amount in foods of plant origin depends on the variety of the plant, soil condition, climate where it grew, length of time since it was picked, storage conditions, and method of preparation.[74][75] The following table is approximate and shows the relative abundance in different raw plant sources.[76][77] As some plants were analyzed fresh while others were dried (thus, artificially increasing concentration of individual constituents like vitamin C), the data are subject to potential variation and difficulties for comparison. The amount is given in milligrams per 100 grams of the edible portion of the fruit or vegetable:
